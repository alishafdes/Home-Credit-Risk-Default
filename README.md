This repository contains a project that we performed as part of the Introduction to Database Management course. The data is from a kaggle competition - [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk).

Due to the high volume of data we performed the analysis in the Databricks platform using a combination of Python and PySpark code. 

The EDA was implemented in Tableau to derive insights which we then proved using machine learning models. Due to class imbalance issues which were present in the data, we used SMOTE techniques on Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Light GBM Models.

A detailed explanation of the approach and insights can be found in the Project Presentation document.
